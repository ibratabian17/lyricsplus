# API Endpoints

This document provides a detailed list and explanation of the API endpoints exposed by the LyricsPlus Backend. These endpoints allow for fetching lyrics, metadata, and submitting user contributions.

## General Structure

All primary API endpoints are organized modularly within the `src/modules/` directory. Each module's handler defines its specific routes.

## Available Endpoints

### Lyrics Retrieval

#### Search Priority with Multiple Identifiers

When both `title`/`artist` and an `isrc` or `platformId` are provided in a lyrics retrieval request, the system prioritizes accuracy by leveraging all available information:

1.  **Full Search Scope**: The system performs a comprehensive search across all configured lyric sources (including external APIs like Apple Music, Musixmatch, and Spotify), not just the local cache.
2.  **Cache Lookup**: During the initial cache check, if a cached entry matches the provided `isrc` or `platformId`, it is considered a perfect match and is returned immediately. This ensures that specific versions identified by an ID are prioritized.
3.  **External API Disambiguation**: If the song is not found in the cache, external APIs are queried using the `title` and `artist`. The provided `isrc` or `platformId` is then used to filter and select the most accurate song from the results returned by the external service.

This approach ensures that providing an `isrc` or `platformId` alongside `title` and `artist` yields the most precise result possible, whether from cached data or external providers.

*   **`GET /v1/lyrics/get`**
    *   **Description**: Fetches synchronized lyrics for a given song in a legacy format, primarily for older YouLy+ clients. Searches can be performed using `title` and `artist`, or by providing an `isrc` or `platformId` for a direct cache lookup.
